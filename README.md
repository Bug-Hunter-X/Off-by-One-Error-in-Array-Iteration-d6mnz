# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The error occurs when the loop condition incorrectly includes the last index, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the code with the error. The `CorrectedArray.java` file provides the corrected version with the explanation.
